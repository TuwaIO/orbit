**A powerful, framework-agnostic foundation for seamless multi-chain blockchain interactions in user interfaces.**

Orbit Utils, developed by **TUWA**, provides the core building blocks and utilities needed to create web3 applications that can easily support multiple blockchain networks like EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) and Solana.

## 🏛️ What is Orbit Utils?

Orbit Utils is a **headless** and **framework-agnostic** library ecosystem designed to simplify the development of cross-chain dApp frontends. It provides a **unified interface** and essential utilities for interacting with different blockchain architectures through a flexible **adapter system**.

**Why Orbit Utils?**

Building user interfaces that interact with multiple blockchains often leads to repetitive code and complex conditional logic. Orbit Utils addresses this by:

1.  **Abstracting Chain Differences:** It provides a common structure (`BaseAdapter`) and selection mechanism (`selectAdapterByKey`), allowing your UI code to be less dependent on the specifics of each chain.
2.  **Providing Common Utilities:** Offers ready-to-use functions for frequent tasks like managing wallet connection state, formatting addresses/chain IDs, handling ENS/Solana name resolution, and generating explorer links, reducing boilerplate code.
3.  **Ensuring Consistency:** Acts as a foundational layer used across TUWA projects, promoting code reuse and standardization.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Multi-Chain Foundation:** Core types and adapter system supporting EVM, Solana, and Starknet (via `OrbitAdapter` enum).
-   **Framework Agnostic & Headless:** Works with any JavaScript framework (React, Vue, etc.) or vanilla JS as it contains no UI components.
-   **Type-Safe:** Fully written in TypeScript for improved reliability and developer experience.
-   **Flexible Adapter System:** Easily select and use chain-specific implementations (`@tuwaio/orbit-evm`, `@tuwaio/orbit-solana`).
-   **Essential Utilities:** Helpers for formatting, chain identification, localStorage management, ENS/Solana name/avatar resolution, explorer links, and async operations.
-   **SSR Safe:** Designed to function correctly in both client-side and server-side rendering environments.

## 🧩 Ecosystem Packages

Orbit Utils is modular:

-   **`@tuwaio/orbit-core`:** The foundational package with core types, the adapter system, and common, chain-agnostic utilities.
-   **`@tuwaio/orbit-evm`:** Provides the adapter implementation and specific helper functions for EVM-compatible chains, using `viem` and `@wagmi/core`.
-   **`@tuwaio/orbit-solana`:** Offers the adapter implementation and utilities for the Solana blockchain, leveraging `gill` and the Wallet Standard.

## 💾 Getting Started

Install the core package and the specific chain adapters you need.

```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended), but you can use npm, yarn or bun as well

# Install Core
pnpm add @tuwaio/orbit-core

# Install EVM adapter (includes necessary peer dependencies)
pnpm add @tuwaio/orbit-evm @wagmi/core viem

# Install Solana adapter (includes necessary peer dependencies)
pnpm add @tuwaio/orbit-solana gill @wallet-standard/app @wallet-standard/ui-core @wallet-standard/ui-registry
````

*(See the individual package READMEs for `npm` and `yarn` commands and detailed peer dependency information)*.
